tyrant_government_desc;A Divine Autocracy is a Feudal realm under the absolute control of a ruler with incredible magical power, such as an ancient sorceror or a true dragon. They are often the focus of a state religion or cult of personality. However, this form of government relies on the ruler's power to stay united. The realm will fracture if they die without a worthy successor. Realms that can no longer operate as Divine Autocracies will revert to Feudal government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
