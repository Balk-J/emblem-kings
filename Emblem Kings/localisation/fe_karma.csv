karma.1.desc;The unrest caused by the unsavory rumors about you has become an open revolt. A large army of peasants has risen up, unwilling to tolerate a [Root.GetTitle] who would stab [Root.GetHerHis] own child in the back. They demand that you abdicate the throne immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.1.A;Preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.2.desc;It's over. A mob has broken down the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], ready to tear you off your throne. Maintaing power is no longer possible, but if you're fortunate, you might be able to escape with your life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.2.A;How did it come to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.3.desc;One of your retainers has come to you with a troubling report. Somehow, details of your murder plot have been revealed to the common folk of [Root.Capital.GetName]. No one is sure where this began, but by now the rumor mill is spinning furiously with tales of the evil [Root.GetTitledName] and [Root.GetHerHis] foul plot to murder [Root.GetHerHis] own child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.3.A;Peasants always complain about their betters. They will soon lose interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.3.B;Make an example of everyone you hear spreading this outrageous slander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.3.C;We must change the story. Send out heralds to remind them of my greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.3.D;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.4.desc;Vile rumors have been circulating about [From.GetTitledName] among the peasantry. Something about a plot of [From.GetHersHis] to murder a child? Could there be any truth to these tales?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.4.A;[From.GetFirstName] is capable of anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.4.B;Nonsense! [From.GetTitledName] is a good [From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.5.desc;The foul rumors about you have spread to the army. Many soldiers who used to garrison your holdings have thrown down their arms in disgust and returned to their villages, proclaiming that you are no [Root.GetTitle] of theirs. Efforts to recruit replacements are... not proceeding very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.5.A;Those traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.6.desc;Tax collection has slowed dramatically in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Some peasants claim they have no gold to spare. The more honest ones say they will not give anything to "that monster of a [Root.GetTitle]." Several tax collectors have been attacked and seriously wounded by the more belligerent ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.6.A;Greedy swine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.7.desc;Unrest has been building among the peasants of [Root.Location.GetName]. Many are unwilling to tolerate your rule. If nothing is done, this could escalate into outright rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.7.A;How dare they?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.19.desc;Your murder plot achieved the desired result. Now that the rush of success has subsided, you have started to worry. Kinslaying on its own is a terrible crime in the eyes of gods and men, but filicide? You can only hope that this was not a terrible mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.19.A;I'm sure everything will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.desc;You can scarcely believe it. Your own [From.GetFatherMother], attempting to kill you? The two of you are not close, to be sure, but to think it's come to this...\n\nHow should a [Root.GetManWoman] respond to such an act?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.A;I'll kill [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.A.tooltip;You will make an assassination attempt of your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.B;That [GetRootFromInsult]! [From.GetSheHeCap] will answer for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.B.tooltip;You will confront your [From.GetFatherMother] about [From.GetHerHis] foul plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.C;[From.GetFatherMotherCap]... can we not talk about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.C.tooltip;You will attempt to reconcile with your [From.GetFatherMother].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.D;I will forgive even this. [From.GetFatherMotherCap] will come to [From.GetHerHis] senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.20.D.tooltip;You decide to take no action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.21.desc;You have been getting tired more easily these days. Simple tasks are exhausting and you find yourself retiring to bed earlier and earlier each evening. Even though the nightmares make it hard to get a good night's rest. You're actually feeling a bit sleepy right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.21.A;I'll just close my eyes for a few minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.22.desc;Lately, you've been unable to focus. What if someone finds out what you did? Maybe they already know... that might be why they're always whispering about you when they think you can't hear. Why can't they understand that you had no choice?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.22.A;What should I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.25.desc;One of your [From.GetSonDaughter]'s servants has reported to you that another attempt has been made on your [From.GetHerHis] life. Apparently, [From.GetFirstName] was mortally wounded and has since passed away. The servant brought [From.GetHerHis] corpse back so you can confirm this for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.25.A;I won't be satisfied until I see the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.25.B;Do you honestly expect me to believe this fantasy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.26.desc;The servant shows you to a small room, containing a bier with a sheet-covered body. You lift the sheet off the body's face - it's truly [FromFrom.GetFirstName], silent and unmoving. For a moment. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] suddenly surges into action, pulling a dagger from beneath the sheet and plunging it into your heart. The last thing you see is [FromFrom.GetHerHis] pitiless gaze...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.26.desc.2;You were right to suspect a trap. Unfortunately, you spotted it too late - the servant's protests distract you long enough for a very much alive [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to sneak behind you and run you through with a sword. The last thing you see is [FromFrom.GetHerHis] pitiless gaze...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.26.A;No! Aargh!;Non ! Aargh !;Nein! Aaaaaah!;;¡No! ¡Aargh!;;;;;;;;;x
karma.27.desc;You were right to suspect a trap. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] bursts into the room, brandishing a sword. You manage to dodge [FromFrom.GetHerHis] first few enraged swings before the servant knocks you over, bouncing your head on the stone floor. Then everything gets blurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.27.A;Wha-what...?!;Qu-Quoi...?!;W-Was ...?!;;¡¿C, cómo...?!;;;;;;;;;x
karma.28.desc;With the rumor of your own death as bait, you lured your [From.GetFatherMother] into an ambush. [From.GetSheHeCap] spotted the trap in time to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself], but took a blow to the head as you fought and is now comatose. You've managed to pass off the whole thing as a tragic accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.28.A;Maybe that is punishment enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.29.desc;It's done. With the rumor of your own death as bait, you lured your [From.GetFatherMother] into an ambush and ran [From.GetHerHim] through yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.29.A;I suppose this is justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.30.desc;[From.GetFirstName] has come to your bedchamber to confront you with the evidence of your plot to kill [From.GetHerHim]. To say [From.GetSheHe]'s angry with you would be an understatement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.30.A;How ridiculous. You cannot prove a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.30.B;Knowing this, you came to me alone and expected to survive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.30.C;I've hated you for a long time now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.30.D;I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.31.desc;Your response starts a heated argument that quickly degenerates into an outright brawl. You put up a valiant effort, but the pure rage of your [FromFrom.GetSonDaughter]'s attacks take you by surprise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.31.A;How?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.32.desc;Your [From.GetFatherMother] was completely unrepentant. That, you somehow expected. The surprising part was how furious it made you. By the time the red haze fades from your vision, your [From.GetFatherMother] lies dead at your feet in a pool of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.32.A;[From.GetSheHeCap] had it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.33.desc;Much to your surprise, your [From.GetFatherMother] seems stricken with guilt. [From.GetSheHeCap] admits to everything and begs your forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.33.A;Of course, [From.GetFatherMotherCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.33.B;No. You will not deceive anyone else again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.34.desc;Much to your astonishment, [From.GetFirstName] is willing to forgive you. The two of you begin talking, and you wind up having your first civil conversation in a long time. You might be able to salvage this relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.34.A;Perhaps we can be a family again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.35.desc;You confess everything and throw yourself on your [From.GetSonDaughter]'s mercy, but [From.GetSheHe] is having none of it. [From.GetFirstName] draws [From.GetHerHis] weapon, and you're too shocked to react properly. Before you know it, you're lying at [From.GetHerHis] feet, bleeding out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.35.A;I was... truly sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.36.desc;[From.GetFirstName] has approached you in your bedchamber. [From.GetSheHeCap] explains that [From.GetSheHe] knows you tried to have [From.GetHerHim] killed, but [From.GetSheHe] is willing to forgive you and try to repair your relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.36.A;...are you soft in the head?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.36.B;I'm sorry. I should be asking for your forgiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.37.desc;[From.GetFirstName] withdraws, looking hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.37.A;[From.GetSheHeCap]'ll be dead soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

karma.38.A;Justice may catch up with you yet, [From.GetFatherMotherCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.39.desc;[From.GetFatherMotherCap] nearly broke down in tears when [From.GetSheHe] heard your offer of forgiveness! The two of you started talking about old times and before you knew it, you'd been swapping stories all night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
karma.39.A;Perhaps we can be a family again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
