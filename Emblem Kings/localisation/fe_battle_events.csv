fe_battle.1.desc;A scene out of legend is playing out on the battlefield. One of the enemy commanders is a manakete, and has assumed dragon form to fight. Many of your soldiers hesitate, unwilling to approach the fearsome beast. \n\nThe Divine Weapon you carry begins to glow with a brilliant light. It can feel the presence of its ancient foe, and it's somehow communicating an instinctive knowledge of how to defeat the dragon. If you allow the weapon to guide your hand, you have no doubt that you will be victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
