fe7.9.desc;Rumors are spreading that a Bernese mercenary, Brendan Reed, has founded a new company called the "Black Fang" somewhere in the mountains of Bern.

Most orders are now issued by her, in her husband's name. Under her guidance, the Fang has... changed. They have stepped up recruitment, and are now accepting people of dubious character - the sort of brigands and butchers they once scorned. The Fang is now accepting jobs from anyone who will pay, regardless of the target's virtue or lack thereof. Many of their new members have been whispering about a powerful sorcerer, who may be the mastermind behind these recent developments...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fe7.12.desc;You wake suddenly in cold sweat with a strong sensation that something is amiss.

fe7.16.A;Oh my.;Malédiction.;Meine Güte.;;Oh, cielos.;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.17.desc;Your guards bring in a covered basket left just outside your palace.

fe7.22.title;The Black Fang Destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.22.desc;The Black Fang are no more.

Their legacy now survives only in the legends and stories spawned from their exploits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.22.A;Good riddance!;Bon débarras !;Die wären wir los!;;¡Ya era hora!;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.23.desc;You have sent word to the Black Fang that you require their services. The method is somewhat indirect, but it's all to ensure no one finds out you want to hire them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.23.A;Now to await their reply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.24.desc;My [Root.GetLordLady], [From.GetTitledName] has asked us to assassinate [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.24.A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.24.B;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fe7.27.A;And why is it so blasted dark in here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.28.desc;The Black Fang have sent a response to your request. Apparently, they will only take contracts on nobles who mistreat the common people. They have no intention of doing your bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.28.A;Assassins with morals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.29.desc;Some assassins broke into your rooms at [Root.Location.GetName] last night. You made short work of them, of course, but they were true professionals - they fought to the last man, and they left no evidence of their employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.29.A;Was this the work of the Black Fang? Who hired them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.30.desc;Your contact at the Black Fang had been silent for longer than expected. Now [Root.GetSheHe] is here to report, and the news is not good. None of the assassins sent after [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] have returned, and the Black Fang will not be sending any more.\n\nThey are also keeping your gold to "cover their expenses.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.30.A;Those useless thugs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.31.desc;You believe that you have kept a low profile long enough for the Black Fang to move on to easier targets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fe7.32.A;Best of luck to you, child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.33.desc;When you enter your bedchamber, the few lights that are still burning suddenly go out. As you look around in the darkness, confused and disoriented, you hear the sound of rustling fabric and footsteps rushing toward you. You never see where the attack comes from - you only feel the knife slide between your ribs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe7.33.A;What?! Villain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
