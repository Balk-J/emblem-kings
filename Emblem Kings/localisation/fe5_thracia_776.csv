fe5_thracia_776.7.A;The rebels must be dealt with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe5_thracia_776.8.desc;We have defeated the invaders and reclaimed Manster! The former vassals of [From.GetLordLady] [From.GetFirstName] have fled their lands to escape judgment at the hands of the people they oppressed.

fe5_thracia_776.10.A;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe5_thracia_776.12.desc;[From.GetTitledName] is a fellow rebel fighting against an oppressive invading army. Perhaps I should offer [From.GetHerHim] my support? [From.GetFirstName] will surely reciprocate, and we would be stronger together...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
