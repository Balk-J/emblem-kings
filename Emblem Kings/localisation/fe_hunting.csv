fe4_hunting.1.desc;I have given the order for a child hunt to be organized in [Root.Location.GetName]. All children between the ages of 7 and 13 will be gathered and brought to the priests, who will shape them into proper Loptyrians fit to stand among the next generation of nobles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.1.A;Or so they say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.2.desc;The child hunt is over for now. Our standing with the church has improved, and Loptous will surely reward us for our loyal service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.2.A;Praise Loptous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.10.desc;Unfortunately, your present situation means that you will not be able to see your witch hunt to its conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.10.A;We will return later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.12.desc;One of the inquisitors on your witch hunt has reported that they saw [From.GetTitledName] attempting to hide a strange mark on [From.GetHerHis] body. The priest believes it is the mark of Loptous - proof that [From.GetFirstName] is an heir to the accursed bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.12.A;We must announce this at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.12.B;I will give [From.GetFirstName] the chance to buy my silence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.12.C;Nonsense! [From.GetTitledFirstName] is no spawn of Loptous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.13.desc;[From.GetTitledName] told the whole court that you have the blood of Loptous! [From.GetSheHeCap] must have found out during that witch hunt [From.GetSheHe] was holding. Your reputation is bound to suffer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.13.A;That [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.14.desc;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nIt has come to my attention that the foul blood of Loptous runs in your veins. I am sure you would prefer that this fact remains a secret. I am willing to keep silent, for a price...\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.14.A;I have no choice but to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.14.B;You'll get nothing from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.15.desc;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nThough I curse your name, I will get you your gold. Just... remain silent about my ancestry. \n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.16.desc;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI do not understand how you could believe I am a descendant of Loptous. I will thank you to keep such ridiculous falsehoods to yourself!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.16.A;The entire court will hear of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.16.B;Could I be wrong about [From.GetHerHim]? I'll stay silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.17.desc;Your priests have discovered a nest of Loptyrians hiding in your very demesne! They have kept their rites hidden for the most part, until an inquisitor assigned to your witch hunt caught them performing a dark ceremony. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.17.A;Burn the witches and all members of their coven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.17.B;They are misguided, but they are still my people. Leave them alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.18.desc;The priests of your witch hunt have made a disturbing find at a village in your demesne. They found a secret cache of relics and documents at an old stone dwelling. The strange pictures and bizarre rituals have much in common with known Loptryrian rites. The peasants of the village swear they did not know about the cache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.18.A;They are clearly Loptryrian cultists. Arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.18.B;This is disturbing, but we have no proof they did anything wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.18.C;Those are actually old pagan artifacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.20.desc;One of your witch hunters claims to have seen [From.GetTitledName] carrying some unusual religious texts. There is no sign of them now, but could [From.GetFirstName] have Loptryrian sympathies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.20.A;I will tell the priests at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.20.B;Spreading such a story would be irresponsible without proof.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.21.desc;It seems one of the members of the so-called witch hunt sponsored by [From.GetTitledName] saw you disposing of some old documents yesterday. The fool thought they were Loptyrian texts and made half the priests at court wonder about your faith! You managed to smooth things over, but your reputation has suffered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.21.A;I'll remember this, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.22.desc;Although your witch hunt did not turn up anything out of the ordinary, it demonstrated your piety to the priests of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fe4_hunting.22.A;We must remain vigilant lest the dark god return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
